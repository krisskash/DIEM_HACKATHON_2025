# ecodrop³ - DIEM Hackathon 2025

> *Blockchain-powered delivery service connecting couriers, lockers, and gig workers for eco-friendly last-mile delivery in Athens.*

A decentralized intermediate delivery platform where couriers deliver parcels to smart lockers, and gig workers (Droppers) pick them up to deliver to customers. Built with blockchain technology for transparent, secure payments.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain Security**: Smart contract escrow system for safe payments
- **MetaMask Authentication**: Web3 wallet-based login with signature verification
- **Smart Locker Network**: 2000+ real ACS Smartpoint locations across Athens
- **Interactive Mapping**: Real-time GPS tracking with Google Maps
- **Transparent Pricing**: €1 base + €1/km (Small), €1.50/km (Medium), €2/km (Large) + 10% platform fee
- **Crypto Payments**: ETH payments with QR codes on Sepolia Testnet
- **Package Tracking**: Complete job lifecycle from creation to delivery
- **Privacy First**: SHA256 encryption for customer delivery addresses

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- Google Maps JavaScript API (Places, Geocoding)
- Leaflet.js for secondary mapping views
- QRCode.js for payment QR generation
- Web3/MetaMask integration

**Backend:**
- Node.js + Express.js REST API
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- JWT authentication + ethers.js signature verification
- "Blockchain integration" (Sepolia Testnet)

**Blockchain:**

- Smart contract escrow system
- CoinGecko API for live ETH pricing

**External APIs:**
- Google Maps JavaScript API (Places, Geocoding, Distance Matrix)
- CoinGecko API (cryptocurrency pricing)
- OpenStreetMap (alternative map tiles)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Setup environment variables
# Create .env file with:
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/diem_delivery
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here

# 3. Ensure MongoDB is running
# (Use MongoDB Compass or local MongoDB instance)

# 4. Add your Google Maps API Key
# In the following files, replace 'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY' with your actual API key:
# - public/customer-dashboard.html (line 7)
# - public/profile.html (line 7)

# 5. Start development server
npm run dev

# 6. Open browser
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000
```

### First Time Setup


1. **Get Google Maps API Key**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable **Maps JavaScript API** and **Places API**
   - Create credentials (API Key)
   - Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in the HTML files
2. **Sign up** on the platform and connect your wallet

## Smart Locker Network

### Real Locker Locations in Athens

The platform features **real ACS Smartpoint lockers** across Athens, scraped from Google Maps Places API. The database contains actual locker locations with:

- **100+ verified locker locations** throughout Athens metropolitan area
- Real addresses, coordinates (lat/lng), and place IDs
- User ratings and reviews from Google Maps
- Coverage across all major neighborhoods and districts

### Data Collection Process

We used the **Google Maps Places API** to discover and validate real locker locations:

1. **Search Query**: "ACS Smartpoint locker Athens" 
2. **API Integration**: Google Places API with autocomplete and geocoding
3. **Data Scraping**: Automated collection of locker metadata
4. **Validation**: Verified coordinates, addresses, and availability
5. **Storage**: Stored in MongoDB with `data/lockers.json` backup

### Interactive Map Features

**Powered by Google Maps JavaScript API:**
- Real-time locker markers with custom icons
- Search and filter lockers by location
- Distance calculation from user location
- Interactive map with zoom and pan
- Click locker markers to view details and select
- GPS location services for nearby lockers

## How It Works

### For Customers:
1. **Create Order** - Select pickup locker and enter delivery address
2. **Pay with ETH** - Scan QR code, pay on Sepolia Testnet
3. **Track Delivery** - Monitor job status in real-time
4. **Receive Package** - Confirm delivery with verification code

### For Droppers (Gig Workers):
1. **Browse Jobs** - View available deliveries with earnings
2. **Accept Job** - Commit to delivery and get locker access code
3. **Pick Up** - Retrieve package from smart locker
4. **Deliver** - Complete delivery and earn 90% of fees

## Pricing Model

**Base Fee:** €1 (all packages)

**Distance Multipliers:**
- **Small** (letters, documents): €1.00/km
- **Medium** (shoeboxes, up to 2.5kg): €1.50/km (1.5x)
- **Large** (boxes, 5kg+): €2.00/km (2x)

**Platform Fee:** 10% of subtotal

**Dropper Earnings:** 90% of delivery fee

**Example:**
- Small package, 5km distance
- Calculation: €1 base + (€1 × 5km) = €6
- Platform fee: €0.60
- **Total:** €6.60
- **Dropper earns:** €5.94
